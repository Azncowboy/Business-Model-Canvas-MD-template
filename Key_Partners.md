# Key Partners
      -Airbnb+local hotels:Would provide vital exposure to the tourism industry.
      -Local bars, restaurants, and shopping:Would provide destination points scattered throughout a city (as opposed to targeting specific office sites, for example).
      -Local governments:Would need regulatory approval (and certain legislation to ensure no liability).
      -Sporitng Goods stores:Could provide the initial transportation forms; ultimately, we would want to build and brand our own transportation modes, especially afterlearning what is most effective (bikes, scooters, tollerblades, etc.).
      -Local tech start-ups:Provide exposure (word of mouth) to residents most likely to fit into our target demographic.
      -Paypal and other cashless payment services:Would reduce costs and add a measure of autgenticity.
      -For initial phases:Universities, airports, big businesses; specifically student organizations
      -Instacart, Lyft, Doordash, Postmates, and Grubhub:Work together to better each other.
