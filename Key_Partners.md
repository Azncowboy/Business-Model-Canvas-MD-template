# Key Partners

As a start up, we want to collaborate with many different organizations and determine which ones support our business model best. When we become a more matured company, we have a lot to risk. Therefore, we want reliable and long term relationships. Below is a list of companies that we want to establish partnership with:

*Note: the most preferred key partners have check marks in the front of the sentences.*

- [x] ***Airbnb+local hotels:*** Would provide vital exposure to the tourism industry.
- **Local bars, restaurants, and shopping:** Would provide destination points scattered throughout a city (as opposed to targeting specific office sites, for example).
- **Local governments:** Would need regulatory approval (and certain legislation to ensure no liability).
- **Sporitng Goods stores:** Could provide the initial transportation forms; ultimately, we would want to build and brand our own transportation modes, especially afterlearning what is most effective (bikes, scooters, tollerblades, etc.).
- **Local tech start-ups:** Provide exposure (word of mouth) to residents most likely to fit into our target demographic.
- [x] ***Paypal and other cashless payment services:*** Would reduce costs and add a measure of autgenticity.
- **For initial phases:** Universities, airports, big businesses; specifically student organizations
- [x] ***Instacart, Lyft, Doordash, Postmates, and Grubhub:*** Work together to better each other.

Some of our partners are also our competitors, but they have struggle launching a product, or service, so we partner with them to achieve common revenue.

Companies like Uber and Airbnb are in the same industry with us, but they don't offer the same service with us. So, we can help filling the gap. By joining them in an adventure, it helps us grow customers and increase sales.
