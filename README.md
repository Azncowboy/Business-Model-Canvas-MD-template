      <b><a href="Financial_Plan.md">Cost Structure</a></b>
The initial cost of any business can be fairly high. Especially when you put it side-bt-side to the revenue that is made the first year. Here at Hybrid Commute we have come up with a strategic cost structure plan that lays out our start up cost, first year, second year, and third year. 
      
**Important Cost.** It is hard to narrow down the list of important cost when first starting a business. It all depends on what type of business you are starting. We have chosen to rent a space in downtown Omaha. Our first cost will be lease/furnishings/utilities. This will give us a space to create our website, obtain a license, supplies, and insurance. Marketing/Manufactering and Payroll services are also in our top priority list. These cost will give us a solid foundation to start our business.


**Most Costly Key Resources.** With any good business is required an initial sacrifice. We pride ourselves on a solid foundation at Hybrid Commute. The first of the two most costly key resources is hardware and office equipment. This would include things like building rent, computers, scanners, furnishings, utilities, and printers. The second of the two most costly key resources is platform. This is a mix of their creation and maintenance of our website and marketing. The initial start up of creating a website is very costly, but the maintenance to keep a flourishing website is also a high maintenance cost. The marketing side of this is on the top as well. It involves sponsoring local events, creating and paying for ads, having legs on the ground, and being active on social media.       

**Most Costly Key Activities.** We have taken special interest in our key resources. We want to keep our customers safe and happy. We plan on keeping our prices competitive and partnering with other businesses to keep our customers safe. One of the most costly key activities relates to a key resource. That is the start up and maintenance of our website. This can be costly because we value our customers. We have chosen to spend more time and resources creating and bettering our website and app. Our app includes multiple safety features for our customers. Both Riders and Drivers.

**Cost of Establishing and Running the Business.** The cost of establishing a business can vary greatly. As the founders of Hybrid Commute, we have worked diligently to create a budget plan as to not start our business in great debt. The startup for our business is between $26,000-$27,000. The first year cost is roughly $49,000 give or take. Every year for the first three years the cost goes up $100.

      <b><a href="Financial_Plan.md">Revenue Streams</a></b>
As a young company, all revenue is good revenue and it will be a starting point to build from for the future. Thus, Hybrid Commute draws on a revenue model below to drive revenue from each Customer Segment:

**Freemium and Subscriptions.** By attracting customers to the basic set of services and features, we aim to provide paying customers premium services such as material handling, comfort, weekend discount, etc. Our inside track club is $29.99 for a year and offers these premium services.

**Advertising and Affiliate Marketing.** Our free-to-download apps, community forum, blog and services have grown mostly thanks to advertising. By offering  travel guidance and commute solutions services, we make commissions by referring other products and services to customers. We only recommend products that we find beneficial to our customers (personalized offers using data about users’ spending).

**Sponsorship.** As mentioned, we have a small team of developers providing useful, engaging and possibly unique apps to support the business process and customer relationship. They survive by ads and donations from users and customers. For this, we include a PayPal donate button and kindly ask users for coffee and beer.

**Fee-based.** This model is intended to generate significant revenue for Hybrid Commute. It requires a large pool of users to find our main services (commute solution and transportation rental services) valuable enough to pay a small fee. These fees can be either percent-based or flat.

With this revenue model, Hybrid Commute aims to fine-tune our sales engine and make it a top priority.
