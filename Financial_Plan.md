### Note on Revenue Accounting:
1. Number of customers was estimated by using reference 1. In this estimation, I follow the 30% growth each year of Lyft and Uber. But, since we are a young company and have a lot of potential to grow fast in the first few years, I tripled the amount.

2. Subscription revenue was estimated by using reference 2. Assume we charge $80 / year for membership cost (similar to Costco and Sam’s Club) and only half of our users subscribed to this service.

3. Advertising revenue was estimated by using reference 3. Since, we offer multiple services and do not focus on advertising, the revenue per user is 60% of Facebook’s revenue.

4. Affiliate revenue was estimated by using reference 4 and 5. Hybrid Commute is a medium high value business. Therefore, we recommend similar services to customers only. We take large commission rates that range from 5% to 30%, with 20% on average. Also, Lyft is earning $30 per quarter for every active rider. We can use these numbers to estimate our revenue.

5. Sponsorship was estimated by using reference 6. In this estimation, the sponsorship market has a growth of 4.3% yearly, our audience size is 22,000 people (from social media, community forum, etc.), average sponsorship cost is $700 and we have about 10 sponsorships each year.

6. Fee-based for our main services was estimated using mostly my own assumptions. These fees can be either percent-based or flat. For commute solutions service, we take 7% out of the user cost for their trip. For transportation rental service, we charge the same as U-Haul and Enterprise. Also, on average, Americans are spending anywhere between $2,000 and $5,000 on transportation each year and we have 5% market share in the beginning.

###Note on Cost Structures

The most important cost for our business is the startup cost. Since getting a license is the primary phase and most important.

Payroll, Employees(Hiring, Traning), manufacturing costs are the most expensive key resources.  The fixed costs can be rent, maintenance, and license fee.

To establish and run the business smoothly. Together with the Revenue component, we can easily estimate the profitability of our business. A hybrid commute should create confidence that the cost and revenue are in balance.
