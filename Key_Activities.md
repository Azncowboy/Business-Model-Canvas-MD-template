<p>Hybrid Commute, like most transportation companies, rely heavily on platform to do business that customers are increasingly adopting. Thus, the lionâ€™s share of our budget is spent on developing and supporting the system, as the customer base grows.

With this platform and as an inside note, we are developing an app that gathers and transfers carpooling requests. It has features like recommendation, automatically updating, organizing and establishing connection with partners.

A part of our job is to provide customer support, keep prices competitive and negotiate with partners.

Our HR team is focused on recruiting and training people, who want to collaborate in a diverse, inclusive environment.

Raising brand awareness is an ongoing job, but necessary to help our company grow and expand. For this, we have writers, bloggers and content creators to post new content every day. They work alongside with our marketing team and have the responsibilities of collecting user data to help company leaders make decisions.</p>
